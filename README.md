# audio_course_project
Project done as part of Audio Processing course at Tampere University.  

Topic was separation of harmonic and percussive elements according to paper 
SEPARATION OF A MONAURAL AUDIO SIGNAL INTO HARMONIC/PERCUSSIVE COMPONENTS BY COMPLEMENTARY DIFFUSION ON SPECTROGRAM.
Ono, N., Miyamoto, K., Le Roux, J., Kameoka, H., & Sagayama, S. (2008, August).

Biggest challenges was getting started with the algorithm,
and once it was done it needed a bit of optimization with initial runs of 6 minute song
taking 15 minutes. I managed to reduce it to 1/100 of the initial length, to a whopping 9 seconds.
